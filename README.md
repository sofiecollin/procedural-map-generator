# Procedural Map Generator for Autonomous Driving Simulators

In autonomous driving, simulators can be very useful for training and testing the behaviour of a vehicle. However, the
problem of many existing simulators is that they are lacking in provision of varying environments. In this project, a parameterized
procedural map generator was created with the aim to contribute to an improvement in that area. Mainly, this was done by
implementing and combining a terrain- and a road generator. Traffic was also added to provide a sense of realism. The finished product
fulfills many of the desired requirements but there is also plenty of room for improvement and continued addition.
